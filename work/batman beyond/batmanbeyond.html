                Alright this is my batman beyond painting with reference "Batman beyond new 52" comic series.
                <br>
                <br><span>Difficulties:</span><br>
                    The material of the suit doesnt exit in this world so it was kinna hard to find a cloth-armor thing.
                    The Perspective.I choose a kinna weird angle with 3 vanishing points which i am not so trained at.
                <br><br><span>Quick sum of the story:</span><br>
                    The suit is programmed for one thing only. That Batman will succeed even if the man inside cannot.
                    The suit was the reason that Damien Wayne never returned to the cave after his first fight with that suit and Bruce never saw him again. <br>
                That gave me the opportunity to make a more evil batman beyond and I think i delivered pretty good on that.
