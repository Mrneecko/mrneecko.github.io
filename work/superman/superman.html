            <p>
                This is yellow lantern superman inspired by injustice comic series.
                Superman turns evil and just when he is about to lose from Batman and his allies, 
                Sinestro offers him a yellow ring. This ring is fuelled by anger and Clark Kent has 
                a lot inside since he just lost pregnant Lois to the joker.
                Actually joker made superman kill Lois with his own hands after exposing him to fear toxic with kryptonite.<br><br>

                Difficulties: <br>
                This is my first time using procreate so I am not used to it. I overcame this problem by just using the soft round broush 
                for the whole painting so i was more focused on creating and less worrying about the enviroment. <br><br>

                Overall: <br>
                I think I nailed the pose and the expression.Especially fist and eyebrows.Hair is one of the things I am currently struggling and
                maybe the light from the ring on his face could be done better. <br><br>

                I have the whole painting proccess in my instagram freed just in case you want to check it out. <br><br>

                You can download the image for free by clicking this button and use for personal use. Any other use is also legal just by mentioning my name
                Unfortunately the image is not 4k since I totally over looked that setting when procreate asked me. I am used to having it ready in photoshop.
